# The New Dollar

We are building a one of a kind stablecoin that the world has never seen before. This stablecoin uses a very unique pattern and is designed to incentivize people who own these coins to spend them as fast as possible to stimulate the economy. This bank is developing a stablecoin whose user balances reset anytime the bank upgrades their stablecoin smart contract. This means that if the bank has an upgrade every 30 days, you no longer own these stablecoins at the end of the month.

## Problem

Design an ERC20 compliant token where the balances reset every time you upgrade it.
If you own this stablecoin in January, and there is always a smart contract upgrade at the end of each month, then in February, you should not own those stablecoins anymore. Your token should have all ERC20 interfaces and events. You can use whatever framework or version of solidity that you would like, but you cannot use a framework for handling the creation of the proxy contracts. It would be great to have a few tests to demonstrate functionality without having to manually run through things.

## Bonus
Build the token so that users balance resets automatically every 30 days in addition to resetting when the smart contract upgrades. This means that the balances will reset when there is a smart contract upgrade, and they will reset on the 30 day schedule.
